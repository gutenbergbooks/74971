<p>The marvelous development of the motion
picture and the important place it has won in
the heart of the entire civilized world have
attracted an interest never before attained
in so short a time by any form of amusement.
The author of this volume has commendably
explained the essential facts in the history
of this popular art, and the principles allied
with it of most general interest to the public
at large. It contains answers to questions
commonly and constantly asked, and I believe
that its perusal will be well worth while.</p>

</div>


<p>Both as a form of entertainment and as
an educational force the motion picture now
merits consideration in the front rank of the
world’s activities. Conservative estimates
state that twelve million persons attend the
picture theaters of the United States every
day. Were figures available for Europe they
could not add any to the amazement of those
who remember that the motion picture’s
strides to its present popularity have been
taken in a period of less than twenty years.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is because of the rapidity of its
growth that the art is still a mystery to the
layman. In this book the author has set
himself the task of answering the hundred
and one questions that must occur frequently
to followers of the motion picture. In a
logical manner every stage in the process of
making motion pictures is covered, while
due attention has been paid to the historical
and business phases of the subject. A studied
effort has been made to use terms clear to
the lay mind. With the task completed, it
is the conviction of the author that the reader
will find his puzzling doubts replaced by a
clear understanding that should add immeasurably
to his interest in the motion-picture
art.</p>

<p>Additional chapters of instruction in the
writing of photoplays have been included in
the belief that they will meet a widely-felt
need for accurate information and authoritative
advice on this aspect of the silent
drama. Though the book is explanatory
throughout, a chapter of specific advice to
the amateur organization desirous of staging
a motion picture has been provided. This
is an untouched field in works on pictures,
and one that we believe is steadily becoming
of interest to a wider circle.</p>

<p class="ph3">HISTORY AND PRINCIPLES OF MOTION
PICTURES</p>


<p>Like practically all other modern mechanical
wonders, the motion picture
was not the invention of any one man.
Rather, the picture as we know it to-day is
the cumulative result of the toil and experiments
of a score of workers, whose efforts
cover over half a century. As far back as
1795 scientists were striving to produce the
phenomena of pictures that moved. Succeeding
generations all saw experimenters
working toward the same object, each contributing
his mite of improvement, until,
with Thomas A. Edison’s invention of the
kinetoscope, in 1893, the day of modern
motion pictures dawned.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>
<p>Though all these seekers for knowledge
worked constantly with “pictures of objects
in motion” as their goal, it is not possible
that any saw in the motion picture the possibility
of development to its present important
place. Dreamers as they necessarily
were, there were no imaginations even
among picture-men of the last decade that
would dare such wide stretches of fancy.
No other artistic or industrial development
of history will bear comparison with the
motion picture’s leap from humble beginnings
to exalted favor.</p>

<p>Let us go back to the lowly antecedents
of the present-day giant. In the year 1830,
we find a description of the zoetrope, or
“Wheel of Life,” which was introduced in
the United States in 1845. Though pretending
to be nothing more than a toy, the zoetrope
embodied the optical principle that is
at the basis of all motion-picture work.
It consisted of a revolving cylinder, in appearance
much like a common hat-box, with
the top removed to permit the light to enter.
Vertical slots were made equal spaces apart
around the upper half of the cylinder, and
ten or more drawings showing a particular
object in different positions were placed
around the lower half of the interior. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>cylinder revolved on a vertical spindle, and
the spectator, peering through the slots, received
the impression of seeing the object on
the interior in motion. Simple drawings
were used, a favorite being the figure of a
dancer.</p>

<p>The similarity between the zoetrope, despite
the fact that it did not make use of
photography, and the modern motion picture,
lies in the scientific principle responsible
for the illusion of moving figures. In
viewing a particular object there is the
briefest delay in conveying the impression
from the eye to the brain, so that the latter
has the conception of seeing the object after
it has actually passed from the field of vision.
If, during this fractional part of a second, another
picture of the object, in a slightly different
position, is presented to the eye, the
brain’s sensation will be that of having seen
the object move. Were a series of such pictures
moved before the eye in rapid succession,
the impression registered would seem more
like a streak than an object in motion, so
that there must be some way of cutting off
the vision until the second picture has been
moved into the exact position held by the
first, and so on. The spaces between the
slots in the zoetrope served this purpose,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>and so rapid was the revolution of the cylinder
that the spectator was not aware of
having had his vision interrupted, and only
received the impression that on a direct
line with the eye there was an object which
seemed to be moving.</p>

<p>To understand the application of this
principle to modern motion pictures let us
take a strip of film a foot in length as an
example. There are sixteen separate pictures
on this piece of film. The screen of
the motion-picture theater serves as the
fixed point at which the spectator is gazing.
One second is required to show this foot of
film on the screen, and the spectator is of
the opinion that pictures have been shown
throughout that entire second. In reality,
the shutter of the projection-machine threw
each separate picture on the screen for about
one thirty-second of a second, and there
was an interval of about the same duration
while the next picture was being moved
into place.</p>

<p>The zoetrope had many successors, as new
devices of improvement were discovered. It
never became much more than a toy, however,
interesting solely because the simple
objects shown appeared to move. The next
important chapter in motion-picture history
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>concerns the experiments of Edward Muybridge,
an Englishman, in 1871-2. Photography
had by this time advanced so that it
was possible to take pictures with an exposure
of less than one-twentieth of a second.
Muybridge conceived the plan of using several
cameras to photograph an object in
motion. Governor Leland Stanford, of
California, offered to finance an experiment
by which pictures were to be taken of his
race-horse, Occident.</p>

<p>Muybridge placed twenty-four cameras
along the rail of the California race-track,
where the attempt was to be made. Strings
were stretched across the track from each of
the cameras and adjusted so that when the
running horse broke them it would operate
the shutter in such a manner that each camera
secured a photograph of the animal. Muybridge’s
success received world-wide notice
and set the scientists of Europe and America
to renewed efforts to perfect the motion-picture
idea. Some progress was made in
the decade immediately following, the French
worker, Dr. Marey, being especially successful.</p>

<p>But for many reasons Muybridge’s methods,
and those of his followers, were not fitted
to practical use. These faults all found their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>basis in the necessity of using cumbersome
glass plates in making the photographs, so
the search began for a flexible substance on
which pictures could be taken. Gelatine
was utilized in many different ways, with
little success; preparations of all sorts were
tried on paper. Our own Edison was working
on the problem in the early eighties, and
made many important discoveries regarding
pictures, but they were not to see practical
application until the invention of celluloid
film.</p>

<p>History, in this case found in dusty court
records, awards the priority of patent on the
process of making motion-picture film to the
Rev. Hannibal Goodwin, of Newark, New
Jersey. In the years between 1885 and 1887
the clergyman, working independently, and
George Eastman, experimenting with his co-worker,
Walker, evolved a flexible film of
which celluloid was the basis. Eastman’s
company began the manufacture of the film
on a large scale, and waxed strong, while
Goodwin, and later his heirs, were forced to a
court battle that did not end until 1914, when
a final decision was given in favor of the
owners of the Goodwin patents. At present
the Eastman Company manufactures practically
all of the world’s film supply under an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>arrangement with the holders of the Newark
clergyman’s patents.</p>

<p>When Edison saw that the flexible film was
successful in ordinary photography he again
turned to serious work on motion pictures,
and the Chicago World’s Fair, held in 1893,
saw the introduction of his kinetoscope.
This was a coin-in-the-slot device and a nickel
was the charge at that time to view a picture
about thirty seconds in duration. The novelty
soon wore off, mainly because the pictures
were so short, and Edison placed the
kinetoscope on the shelf. Apparently foreign
mechanical workers attending the Fair
thought more of the apparatus than did its
inventor, for in the years immediately following
they made many advances on the
original model, while Edison had even neglected
to patent his invention abroad. Paul
in London, Lumière in France, and numerous
others were at work, and by 1896 signs
of their success were apparent. The result
was that Edison again turned to his kinetoscope,
and soon he presented an improved
machine, the vitascope, which could be
used in theaters to show pictures on a
screen.</p>

<p>The motion picture was here. It was not
long before pictures were being shown in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>theaters in Paris and London, and in July,
1896, Lumière’s cinematograph was exhibited
at the Union Square Theater in New
York. Others entered the field, some of the
pioneers being Siegmund Lubin, William N.
Selig, Henry Marvin, George Kleine, Francis
Marion, William T. Rock, Albert E. Smith,
and J. Stuart Blackton. These early picture-men
were also, by necessity, somewhat capable
as inventors, and numerous patents were
secured on different portions of the apparatus
for making and exhibiting pictures. The
next few years of the industry’s history is
the tale of numerous patent suits that wound
in and out of the courts. The legal battles
accentuated the naturally bitter competition
to be expected in exploiting the new wonder.
But the public had given a hearty welcome
to the latest form of entertainment, and the
picture-makers waxed prosperous, despite the
handicap of internal strife. Theaters in all
the big cities were showing the pictures as
novelties, and traveling exhibitors were frequent.
The “store show,” a picture theater
made by remodeling a common store, came
into being, and to supply them with pictures
exchanges were opened all over the country.
These exchanges were the “middle-men” of
the picture field, buying the films from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>manufacturers, and in turn renting them to
the theater-owners.</p>

<p>The patent litigation came to an end in
1908 when a group of the most important
companies united to protect their patents,
and to distribute their output through a common
channel. For a time it seemed that the
motion picture was to become a monopoly.
But the independents, by co-operation with
foreign manufacturers, succeeded in maintaining
their position, so that the field is to-day
as open to individual activity as any
other line of commercial effort.</p>

<p>In the years immediately preceding the
organization of this group of the biggest
concerns, the picture itself was not progressing.
There was no longer any novelty in
seeing people in motion on the screen, and
the inane subjects shown offered little more
than that. While the pessimists, who, as a
matter of fact, had never taken a deep interest
in the motion picture, were predicting
its early demise, the manufacturers set about
to find means of renewing the interest. Short
dramas and comedies were written, and players
drafted from the stage. The public responded
readily, and once more Fortune
smiled upon the picture-men, never again to
desert them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>
<p>Until about 1911 the average motion picture
was approximately one thousand feet
long, and occasionally two or more distinct
subjects were included on a piece of film this
length. The reels on which the film is wound
for easy handling will hold one thousand feet,
so that in the United States a picture of this
length came to be known as a “single-reel”
picture. In England and on the Continent
this term has not come into general use, the
practice being to state the approximate
length of the film in feet or meters. Though
Richard G. Holloman’s three-thousand-foot
or three-reel production of “The Passion
Play,” in 1905, had proved most profitable,
the American manufacturers did not heed
the indication that audiences would welcome
stories longer than one thousand feet. Foreign
producers were quicker to see the possibilities
of the longer picture, but as recently
as 1912 their productions of greater length
than two thousand feet were offered without
response on the American market. Then
came the success of “Quo Vadis?” an Italian
multiple-reel picture, exploited in this country
by George Kleine, of Chicago, to whom
credit must be given for the rise of the long
production, with its results in placing the
picture in the best theaters in the country.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>“Quo Vadis?” earned a fortune, and was followed
by a scramble on the part of buyers
to get the long-neglected foreign productions,
while the American manufacturers turned
their attention to the staging of multiple-reel
pictures.</p>

<p>To-day the short picture, though still
forming the bulk of the output, is somewhat
neglected, for the quickest way to the public’s
fancy seems to lie in the big production
that rivals the stage-play. In Europe the
long picture is declining in favor, and the
picture of one and two thousand feet returning
to popularity. In the United States,
however, it would seem that the future of the
motion picture lies in the production that
gives an entire evening’s entertainment, offering,
as it does, opportunities for the exercise
of artistic effort that are denied by the fifteen
or thirty minute picture.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE STUDIO—THE MECHANICS OF PICTURE
MAKING AND SHOWING</p>


<p>Picture studios dot the map of the
world. One or more will be found in
practically every capital of Europe. In
France there are three principal manufacturing
companies, each with a chain of
studios. Germany and the Scandinavian
countries likewise produce a number of pictures,
while Italy ranks second to France
in the European field. For reasons probably
finding their root in the stolid British temperament,
England has not kept pace with
France, Italy, and the United States as a producer
of film. Within recent years, however,
there have been signs of an awakening on
the part of the English which should give to
that country a more fitting place in the new
art.</p>

<p>Los Angeles and New York, and the territory
around these cities, share the honors as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>picture-producing centers in the United
States. Several other large cities have picture
studios, however, and the list is constantly
being added to by the search for new settings
or the enterprise of local capitalists.
New York has been found to be ideal as a
location because of the variety of scenery,
from seashore to crowded city street or pretty
rural settings within easy reach. But southern
California, with almost continuous sunshine,
has become the picture Mecca and it is
estimated that over one-half of the world’s
picture-supply is made there.</p>

<p>Around New York the studios are almost
all solely for indoor work, the producers
using the “highways and byways” for their
outdoor scenes. In California, however,
several of the companies own estates covering
many hundreds of acres, and it is seldom
necessary to go off the company’s property
to take any scene desired. Dotting the estates
you will find village streets that would
seem to have been transplanted from the
four corners of the globe. Well-stocked zoos,
that would be the prize possession of many
a municipality, are a unique feature of some
of these plants. Philadelphia also boasts
of a large picture-producing estate of this
type. Indoor studios may be recognized by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>the glass top and sides, an evidence of the desire
for sunlight. Mercury lights and electric
arc-lights are the means of illumination
used for work at night or on days when the
sun’s rays do not prove sufficient.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the workings of the motion-picture
camera is essential to a clear understanding
of the chapters that follow, so it
might be well to include that here. You
have seen the large box camera employed
in the ordinary photographer’s gallery. The
motion-picture camera appears very much
like an enlarged box camera, with the addition
of a crank on the side and a dial to
measure the amount of film used. It is
mounted on a tripod which is also movable,
either laterally or horizontally, by means of
cranks. In all essential points motion-picture
photography is really continuous snap-shot
photography. Celluloid film is used, that for
motion-picture purposes being one and three-eighth
inches wide, and supplied in long
strips, the average length being two hundred
feet. By turning the crank at the side the
motion photographer is able to get continuous
photographs of a person or object in
motion, instead of the single picture that the
snap-shot photographer gets. As each of
these photographs is only three-quarters of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>an inch high, it will be seen that the cinematographer
can take sixteen separate photographs
on each foot of film in his camera.
This “sixteen” is a cabalistic figure in motion
pictures. There are sixteen photographs on
each foot of film. For average work the
camera-man photographs the pictures at the
rate of sixteen to the second, and they are
shown on the screen in the picture theater
at the same speed.</p>

<p>When the camera-man turns the crank
at the side of his camera two independent
mechanisms are affected by the operation,
the shutter and the device for feeding the
film. The shutter is opened to allow the
brief exposure of the film necessary to take
a single picture, and it is then closed while
another three-quarter inch of film is moved
into position ready for the next picture. The
camera-man continues to turn his crank,
thus repeating the operation over and over
again until the entire scene is photographed.</p>

<p>The shutter in motion-picture cameras is
a revolving disk, in which a “V”-shaped
opening is cut, or also the aperture may be
formed by two disks superimposed, in which
case the operator is able to vary the size
of the opening. The operator’s crank is connected
by gears to the shutter, which is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>placed between the lens and the film. The
action of the shutter has been explained in
the paragraph above. It might be stated
here that the exposure of the film is a trifle
longer than that which would be allowed by
the ordinary snap-shot photographer, since
the blurring which results on the picture is
indistinguishable, owing to the rapidity with
which the photographs follow each other on
the screen.</p>

<p>Two light-tight boxes are contained in the
camera, one at the top to hold the raw film,
and the lower one to receive the film after
it has been exposed. Perforations have been
made along the edges of the film before it
is placed in the camera, the holes being oblong
in shape, one-eighth of an inch wide
and one-sixteenth of an inch in height. The
film-feeding device, which is either of the
sprocket-wheel type, which drives the film
through, or the claw-hammer type, which
pulls it, engages in these holes. The perforations
serve a similar purpose in the camera,
the projection-machine, and in the process
of developing the negative and printing the
positives. It will be seen that the perforating,
which is done by machinery, must be
accurate to the one-hundredth of an inch.</p>

<p>The working of the projection-machine,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>the apparatus which throws the image on the
film onto the screen, is in many ways similar
to that of the camera. Or, a simpler comparison,
the projection-machine is really the
familiar stereopticon, or magic lantern, with
the addition of mechanism for feeding the
film rapidly before the light and the lenses.
In the first place, there is a “lamp-house,”
a small cabinet which contains the light,
supplied by means of an arc-light, and the
condensing lens. The light created by the
carbons of the arc, while strong, is diffused
in the lamp-house, and it is the purpose of
the condensing lenses to concentrate the
rays before throwing them on the screen.
The pictures are outlined on the screen because
of the fact that the figures on the film
obstruct light in proportion to their density.</p>

<p>From the lamp-house and the condensing
lenses we naturally pass to consideration of
the film, and the devices by which it is fed
before the rays of light with such accuracy
that the picture is always in place on the
screen, and with such rapidity and uniformity
of speed that the spectator is not aware of
the fact that he is really looking at sixteen
separate pictures each second. The principle
of the operation is similar to that used in the
camera. The film passes from a fire-proof
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>magazine above, being pulled out by a sprocket-wheel
that engages in the perforations.
After passing from these sprockets there is a
brief respite for the film, a loop being provided
to relieve it so that the pull will not be
too great when passing through the film-gate
which holds the image in place before
the rays of the condenser. It is necessary
that the gate hold the film perfectly taut
and in alignment, for it can be seen that the
slightest fractional deviation would appear
great when the image is magnified by the
objective lenses onto the screen.</p>

<p>Below the film-gate we find another sprocket-wheel,
this one to pull the film through
the gate, being operated by an intermittent
movement. This movement brings the required
length of film before the condensing
lens’s rays, allows it to remain there the necessary
length of time, and then repeats the
operation over and over until the entire reel
is shown. Improvements in projection-machines,
and especially in the “intermittent
movement,” have eliminated the flickering,
“jumpy” pictures we remember so well only
a few years ago. The film is put in motion
by a crank at the side of the machine, operated
either by hand or by electric power. It is
the function of the intermittent movement
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>to convert this rotary motion into the short
rectilinear motions that move the film, with
the corresponding rests while it is being
shown. The principal type of intermittent
movement consists of a revolving “pin”wheel,
operated by the turning of the crank.
The pin engages in the arm of another wheel,
a cross in shape, which makes one-quarter of
a revolution, and, since it is connected to
the sprocket-wheel, thus pulls the film
through the gate. At the completion of its
down stroke the pinwheel necessarily disengages
with the arm of the cross and continues
to revolve. But the cross is idle, so the
film is held firm in the gate until the pinwheel
completes the circle and engages with
the next arm of the cross. This will serve
the purpose of explaining the principle of
the intermittent movement, though improvements
and variations are constantly being
made.</p>

<p>The portions of the projection-machine yet
unexplained are the objective lens and the
shutter. The lens, which is immediately in
front of the film-gate, receives the rays of
light passing through the film from the condenser
and throws them on the screen. The
shutter, which is usually of the revolving-disk
type, interrupts the light while the film
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>is being moved to allow the next photograph
to reach the correct position. It may be remarked
here that the film cannot be allowed
to remain in the film-gate indefinitely, for
the intense heat of the light from the condenser
would soon ignite it. This occasionally
happens when the film buckles, and the
operator’s first thought when there is trouble
with his machine is to shut off the light.
Safety fire appliances prevent the blaze from
spreading beyond the film-gate.</p>

<p>The motion photographer is able with the
aid of his camera to perform any number of
miraculous feats. He can have one man
play two or three parts on the screen at one
time, thus having an actor engage in conversation
with himself, and so on. And then,
readers are most likely all familiar with the
pictures showing magical appearances and
disappearances of characters. Or the picture-maker
can give you a thrilling view of the
burning of a city, yet he need not have
journeyed outside the studio or expended
more than a few dollars to get the scene.</p>

<p>The use of models built in exact miniature
explains the producer’s ability to burn a
thriving metropolis to the ground so easily.
The wreck of an ocean liner is another feat
accomplished in a small tank with papier-maché
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>models. When photographed with
the camera comparatively close these scenes
appear on the screen to be absolutely realistic,
though to the spectator in the theater
it seems that the camera was placed at a great
distance. Readers who remember the startling
volcanic eruption shown in “Cabiria”
have evidence of the remarkable deceiving
power of the models.</p>

<p>Plays with twin brothers or sisters in the
principal rôles became popular with picture producers
after they discovered that it was
possible to have one player appear simultaneously
in the two parts. This is accomplished
by “double exposure,” which, as the
words indicate, is performed by exposing
the same strip of film twice. Take the case
mentioned, the showing of twin brothers, as an
example. First a hair-line division is made
of the stage, marking off the two parts on
which the different brothers are to appear.
Then the scene on one side of the stage is
photographed, the film on the other side being
protected from exposure—“masked” is
the technical term. Following the photographing
of this scene, the actor playing the
twin brothers steps to the other side of the
stage and, with the action already photographed
now “masked,” the same strip of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>film is run through the camera. When the
picture is developed it will appear as though
two actors appeared in the scene. In making
such scenes the director of the production
makes use of a split-second watch in order
that the action may be timed perfectly and
that on both sides of the film chime correctly.
It can be seen that a slip of a fraction of a
second can easily make the character’s actions
appear ridiculous. Despite the difficulties
of the work, however, it has become
quite common, and daring directors have gone
so far as to have dual characters, played by
one person, clasp each other’s hands. Where
physical contact is attempted, it will be seen
that the director, in addition to accurately
timing the action on both sides of the film,
must have a marker that will note to the
fraction of an inch the point at which the
character stretched his hand outside the
camera’s range, so that, when the other side
of the film is photographed, the joining will
be perfect. A thread, invisible to the camera,
and stretched from above the stage to the
floor will serve this purpose.</p>

<p>A type of double-exposure work that is,
perhaps, even more familiar to readers is
that used in showing visions, as, for instance,
when the producer desires to show the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>thoughts that are passing through a character’s
mind. The vision may appear in
one of the upper corners of the scene, the more
common method, or, for novelty’s sake, it
may form on the pages of a book the character
is reading. The principle in these
cases is similar to that explained in the twin-brothers
scene. First the action covering
most of the scene is photographed, with that
part of the film masked on which the vision
is to appear. Then the same strip of film is
run through the camera to photograph the
players enacting the action of the vision.
It will be readily apparent that in this work
the camera’s perspective must be altered,
where in the twin-brother scene it was necessary
that there be no change in the position
of the camera until both scenes were photographed.</p>

<p>The magical appearances and disappearances
of characters will be simple to readers
who now understand the operation of the
motion-picture camera. They will see that
it is an easy matter to have a character disappear
by ceasing to turn the crank, covering
the lens, and then having the character
walk off the scene, after which the turning
of the crank is resumed. When the picture
is developed the player will be seen up to a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>certain point, then he will suddenly disappear,
but the other objects in the scene
will appear unchanged. In the same manner
a person can be brought suddenly on the
scene, appearing to spring from the air. Trick
effects may also be secured by running the
film through the camera backward, and
reversing the actions of the players, that
is, making them “do things backward.”
When the film is run through the projection-machine
correctly, and shown on the screen,
you see the player perform such miraculous
feats as jumping from the middle of a river
clear up a steep bank, when in reality to
take the picture he leaped backward from
the bank to the river—but the film was
reversed.</p>

<p>In securing all these effects the producer
does not fail to make use of the power of
suggestion in the mind of the audience. For
instance, the amazing disappearance will be
accompanied by the ignition of a smoke-pot,
so that it will appear that the character
“went up in smoke,” a decidedly more impressive
effect than to have him of a sudden
vanish into thin air. The latter appears too
artificial. In photographing visions, also,
the camera’s eye will be narrowed, then
gradually widened, so that the audience imagines
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>it can see the figures taking shape and
form. With the use of models especially the
power of suggestion must be adroitly employed,
for, if given undistracted opportunity
to examine a scene, the audience would
quickly note its artificiality. If a producer
were forced to use models in depicting a
train wreck, for example, he would be careful
to work up to it by showing views of real
trains speeding along the rails, and even
actual views of the spot at which the wreck
was to occur. The models would then be
built in exact duplicate of this spot. Flashes
of the model trains rushing to destruction
would then be interspersed with close-up
views of the characters in the story, who, we
will say, are supposed to be on one of the
trains, or else they are rushing to a switch
in a vain attempt to prevent the wreck.
Following the crash of the trains the producer
would be quick to give us close-up
views of a real train wreck, probably taken
months before by a news photographer, or
else he might batter a studio-built car, upset
a smoke-pot or two, and have the characters
in the story rush about in the dimly
lit—but apparently harrowing—scene. The
different scenes might be taken days, weeks,
or even months apart, yet when joined together
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>by a careful producer the effect would
be that of a swift, onrushing climax.</p>

<p>What about talking-pictures and natural-color
films? is one of the first questions asked
by the layman. He remembers that perfect
talking-pictures were announced some years
ago, and that kinemacolor pictures which
reproduce all the coloring of nature have
long been on the market. Why have they
not crowded the old black-and-white and
silent pictures out? Let us take the talking-picture
first. The illusion of seeing the characters
and hearing them speak at the same
time is produced by the synchronization of
a phonograph and the picture-projector.
Now, while perfect timing can be secured,
no way has been found to keep the synchronization
perfect. A scratch on the talking-machine
record, for example, can be
seen to result disastrously if it jumps the
conversation a word in advance of the figure
on the screen. Again, motion-picture film
must undergo considerable wear in the projection-machine
and frequently the perforations
are torn. The operator will then cut
the torn piece out and paste the film together
once more. The lost bit of action is not
noticed on the screen; the pictures follow
one another too rapidly for that. But a corresponding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>change cannot be made in the
talking-record, and it does not require many
patches to throw film and phonograph out
of time. It is possible that these mechanical
difficulties will be overcome, and also that
the talking-picture will be perfected so that,
instead of the simplest of scenes as at present,
it will be able to depict the entire action of
an ambitious drama, but to-day it is clear
that the picture patron greatly prefers the
silent drama.</p>

<p>Natural-color films, which are taken by
means of two cameras, photographing separately
the red and green rays of the spectrum,
the two being superimposed in projection,
though more successful than the talking-pictures,
have failed of being universally
adopted. The brilliance of the pictures was
found to be tiring to the eyes, while the depiction
of rapid action without the presence
of a blur or “fringe” around the characters
was found difficult. Open-air stages and
ideal conditions were necessary to secure
the full benefit of the sun, and the requirement
for a specially designed projection-machine
proved a handicap. But the prophet
would be foolish who would pronounce either
natural-color or talking-pictures as dead because
of early failures.</p>

<p class="ph3">MOTION-PICTURE SUBJECTS</p>


<p>The camera’s eye may roam the world
for subjects; its range equals that of the
newspaper or magazine. The stage and literature,
travel, science, news and advertising,
all are open to the motion picture. The
photoplay, presenting a visualized story, is
the most popular form, for the public heeds
quickest the call of entertainment. But
serious students of the motion picture believe
that, in time, its purely amusement
features will be dwarfed by the development
along lines that may be roughly grouped under
the heading “educational.”</p>

<p>Even to-day the news pictorial is one of
the most interesting and profitable of motion-picture
subjects. Five of the picture companies
have representatives stationed all
over the globe, gathering material for these
“animated newspapers,” while there are
scores of small companies covering limited
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>territories with a direct appeal to local picture
theaters. The news pictorial camera-man
must be as alert as his stepbrother, the
reporter, for the competition is every bit as
keen as that in the newspaper field, and a
victory over a rival just as great cause for
elation. But the photographer must be “on
the spot” while his news is happening, so
that his work is much more difficult and his
field limited. Furthermore, the camera-man’s
news must, either by its importance or
its human interest, have an appeal to the
entire country, and the ideal piece of “news-film”
is that which may also be used abroad.
Especially disastrous fires, which can often
be photographed while they are happening,
the effects of train wrecks or other accidents,
personages prominent in the news of the day,
all these are grist for the camera-man’s mill.
Parades are the bane of the pictorial editor’s
life, for he knows that lengthy views are not
of great interest, yet he is often forced to
use them because of the scarcity of views of
real news events. Occasionally the editor of
the news pictorial will create his own news
by having a daredevil perform some unusual
feat.</p>

<p>When the representative has taken his
picture the negative is rushed to the headquarters,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>where it is developed, and the editor
starts to work assembling the film that
has been received from the different field
men. Often there are little office tragedies
when the film is developed and it is found
that a singularly interesting piece of film
must be thrown away because of poor photography.
The news camera-man cannot make
his own conditions; he must take big chances,
for the news will not wait for him. After
the editor has assembled the film that he
can use, subtitles are written, and the completed
films shipped to the various exchanges,
which distribute them to the theaters. The
greatest handicaps the news pictorial has
had to overcome are the difficulty of getting
the film to the theaters while the news is
fresh, and the fact that the news picture’s
life is short. A dramatic picture will live,
that is, earn money by rentals to exhibitors,
almost indefinitely, but the news-film that
is two months old is practically ready for the
shelf.</p>

<p>Commercial reasons have likewise retarded
the development of the educational picture.
Indeed, in view of the return that it was
possible, until recently, to secure from educational
pictures, one must compliment the
manufacturers on the moderate attention
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>they have bestowed on the subject. Theater-managers
have always been wary of offering
their audiences pictures that were avowedly
educational, so that the income from this
source has always been small. Within the
past few years, however, schools and other
institutions of an educational character have
devoted more attention to the possibilities
of the motion picture, and the development
of systematic and profitable methods
of distribution is likely. Once this is
brought about, the growth in importance of
the educational picture is certain to be
astounding.</p>

<p>The “industrial,” which is the trade term
for the picture that is used to advertise a
particular product, is another field that has
been only slightly touched. There are a number
of companies that specialize in such work,
but the stumbling-block thus far has been
the exhibitor’s unwillingness to show the
pictures in his theater. He rightly feels that
the patron who has paid to see the performance
feels cheated when his time is taken up
with a strictly advertising picture. Many of
these “industrials” can be made very interesting,
however, by weaving light stories
around the product to be advertised, so that
the advertiser achieves his purpose indirectly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>and without the necessity of throwing his
sermon broadside at the spectator.</p>

<p>We recollect one such subject which was
circulated by the makers of a brand of ready-made
women’s clothes. An elaborate social
function was the basis of the story, and two
women who had been invited to the affair
the principal characters. One patronized a
select Fifth Avenue tailor who disappointed
her at the eleventh hour and forced madam
to wear an old gown to the function. This
tragedy to the female heart was avoided by
the second woman. More resourceful than
her sister, she purchased the advertised
brand of apparel at a department store and
was later the envied center of attraction at
the society affair. To drive home his lesson
the author now had the patron of exclusive
modistes visit a relative who lived in the
city that was the home of the ready-to-wear
clothes. An invitation to visit the factory
followed, and the camera carried us along
with madam through all the interesting departments.
Though it was advertising, such
a picture could not fail to appeal to women.</p>

<p>Many artists have entered the picture field
either by means of the animated cartoon, in
which the figures seem endowed with life, or
the picture that shows the artist drawing his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>sketches. Since sixteen separate drawings
must be made for each foot of film it will
readily be seen that the work is long and
laborious. The strong lights necessary for
photographing the pictures also make it
trying for the artist, who must work directly
beneath the camera. Mechanical contrivances
are called upon to lessen the artist’s
troubles as much as possible, and many ingenious
schemes are resorted to in order to
photograph rapidly a series of pictures. For
instance, the artist may draw the head, arms,
body, and limbs of a figure and then, by
means of tabs, move them about under
glass plates so as to secure the impression
of animation. The idea of perspective may
be secured by drawing the object in different
sizes, to the proper scale, of course, and then
bringing the object forward from a distance
by using gradually increasing figures, or, by
reversing the process, carrying the object
away. “Stop” cameras are used, which remain
idle while the artist is moving his figures
for the next photograph. Even with all
the recent inventions to facilitate the work,
animated cartoons are by no means easily
made, and a film that can be shown on the
screen in ten minutes is a good week’s labor
for the artist.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>
<p>And now we come to the photoplay—the
picture that tells a story by means of actors.
“Where do the stories come from?” is one of
the first questions asked by the layman,
though the adapted plays and novels provide
their own answer. But what of the ordinary
picture stories that form the bulk of
the offerings on the screen? Are they bought,
like magazine stories, from writers who submit
to all the magazines, or are they turned
out by staff writers who provide all the
stories needed by each company? How
much do the companies pay for the stories?
How can I enter this profession? The questions
are innumerable. Let us answer them
in turn.</p>

<p>The first motion-picture stories, following
on the period of trick pictures and other
simple scenes, when there was still some
novelty in seeing pictures that moved, were
concocted by the directors and players from
day to day, and were usually of a very simple
nature. But the producers were showmen
enough to see that the public wanted even
better stories, and each studio soon had its
staff writer or two, usually former newspaper-men,
who wrote all the stories required
by the players. But the motion picture soon
outgrew this period, the staffs of writers at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>the studios increased in size, and the call
for stories from outside writers was heard.
During the past few years an increasing
number of the stories have been from the
pens of outside writers, who send their wares
to all the studios just as the ordinary author
submits his manuscripts to the different publishers.
The latest phase is the demand for
the highest quality of stories by the purchase
of play and novel rights for long pictures,
and magazine short-story rights for the short
films.</p>

<p>The staff writer continues, for the producing
companies cannot rely on the outside
writer, though thousands of stories are submitted
each week. And even the stories accepted
must usually be rewritten by the
staff writer to suit the requirements of his
company.</p>

<p>For many reasons the profession of photoplay-writing
is not as rosy as one would be
led to believe by some of the advertisements
of correspondence schools. The prices paid
for stories are not very high, though it can
be said that they are steadily increasing,
and the author of really good work has little
difficulty in securing very good rates. From
fifteen to fifty dollars may be paid for one-reel
stories—that is, pictures that require
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>about fifteen minutes to show. Longer
stories are usually paid for at the same basis
per reel, though here again the well-known
author may demand his own price, or an
exceptionally good idea bring a special reward.</p>

<p>Another fact that renders the writing of
picture stories more profitable for the beginner
as an avocation than a vocation, is
the necessity of meeting unusually trying
conditions. Like the magazines, the companies
favor particular types, but a more
binding rule is the necessity of securing
stories that suit the requirements of the particular
company’s players, or the locality in
which the pictures are being staged at the
time. There are a multitude of smaller circumstances
that may weigh for or against
the purchase of stories regardless of the
question of merit. The staff writer knows
these conditions, his stories are written while
the iron is hot, and he is always ready when
called upon.</p>

<p>Say to any photoplay editor or manufacturer,
“Are you buying stories from the outside
now?” and his reply is certain—it seldom
changes. “We are—if we can get them,”
he tells you. This does not mean that he is
not receiving stories; there is scarcely a studio
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>whose mail is not overloaded with manuscripts.
Nor does it mean that the stories
he accepts must be worthy of being placed
on the screen at once as they are written,
for the scenario editor takes it for granted
that the scripts purchased will have to be
rewritten. It is because over ninety per
cent. of the stories received are absolutely
impossible; one editor places the figure at
ninety-eight per cent. In later chapters we
will take up more fully the reasons which
place these manuscripts in the “rejected”
class.</p>

<p>It was their inability to secure a steady
supply of good stories from the picture ranks
that drove the producers to the magazine
field. The entry of the well-known stage-player
into pictures and the growth in popularity
of the long photoplay caused the purchase
of novels and plays. In addition to
the large sums paid outright for these subjects
the owner of the original rights usually
receives a royalty on the earnings of the picture.
Staff-men employed by the picture
companies adapt the plays and novels to the
form suitable for presentation by means of
motion pictures.</p>

<p>The censoring of pictures is a subject of
interest to those who aspire to write photoplays.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>In choosing his theme the amateur
must remember that the manufacturer is not
anxious to invest money in the production
of a subject that will later have to lie idle
on the shelf because it will not pass the censors.
The most important censoring body,
the National Board of Censorship, was established
voluntarily by the manufacturers
in co-operation with the People’s Institute of
New York. The members of the board,
who are appointed from various sociological
organizations, serve without remuneration,
the only paid employees being the secretaries.
The expenses of the organization
are borne by the manufacturers. The National
Board has been of considerable benefit
to the motion-picture industry, a fact
largely due to the whole-hearted support of
the manufacturers. A manufacturer cannot,
of course, be compelled to submit his
pictures for the approval of the board, but
at present more than ninety-five per. cent. of
the pictures shown in this country are viewed
by its score or more of voluntary committees.
The censors see the pictures at the New York
offices of the producers, usually far enough
in advance to permit of making any changes
they may order before the pictures are distributed.
In addition, state and municipal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>bodies have been established in many sections
of the country. If you intend taking
up photoplay work seriously, write the National
Board of Censorship, 70 Fifth Avenue,
New York City, for a pamphlet explaining
its principles of judgment. It will be worth
your while.</p>

<p class="ph3">STAGING A PICTURE</p>


<p>The cost of producing a motion picture
which provides a full evening’s entertainment
averages between ten thousand
and twenty-five thousand dollars. One-reel
pictures, which require about fifteen minutes
to show in a theater, usually cost in the neighborhood
of a thousand dollars to produce.
It may easily be said that this money is
spent by one man—the motion-picture director—yet,
with all his responsibility, the director
is a character little known to the layman.</p>

<p>Within the picture ranks the terms “director”
and “producer” have become interchangeable,
though not always correctly so.
Directors of the best type are deserving of
the title “producer,” because their completed
productions bear evidence in every
branch of their imagination and creative
ability. But the more common type of director
is really little more than a “stage-manager”;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>he takes the story as it comes
from the author’s hands and, “following instructions,”
stages the manuscript for the
camera. He tells the players what they are
to do in each scene, lays out the scenic requirements,
and so on, but injects none of his
own individuality into the pictures. Between
the two extremes there is the average
director, and it is of his work that we shall
treat here.</p>

<p>Who, then, is the motion-picture director?
We have explained in a preceding chapter
that he is “the man in charge of the making
of the picture.” But here we shall see him
at close range, from the time he receives the
story from the photoplay editor until he
finally turns his negative film into the factory
for developing and editing, after which
the positive prints are made. Between the
manuscript and the completed film many an
interesting event has happened. Perhaps a
factory has been burned to the ground, and
the heroine rescued from almost certain
death; mayhap a daring criminal has run
amuck, only to be brought to bay by the
noted detective and captured after a thrilling
fight; or it is possible that armies have
clashed in battle before a battery of cameras.
But one and all—heroine, criminal, detective,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>and soldier—have answered to the beck and
call of a director. “The world’s a stage,”
and the picture producer’s world is limited
only by the imagination of the author.</p>

<p>With his story in hand a director’s first
task is to select the players for the different
characters in the plot. Each studio has a
large staff of “stock” players—that is, actors
and actresses who are engaged permanently
and who may appear in as many as fifty
different rôles within a year. The most important
of these players are grouped into
smaller companies, placed under the charge
of a particular director. Each of these players
is suited to a particular type of characterization,
and the director now assigns the
principal parts in his story to the players for
whom they are suited. For the minor rôles
he will draw on the stock players not assigned
to any particular company. If the story has
scenes calling for the use of hundreds of characters,
such as a ball-room scene, the Stock
Exchange, or a battle, he will call for “extras,”
who are engaged by the day, either
from the numerous applicants always to be
found waiting expectantly around the studios,
or through agents who make a business solely
of supplying these supernumeraries to the
picture producers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>
<p>In the case of long pictures, or “features,”
as the trade term is, a prominent stage-player
is often engaged for the leading rôle.
In the selection of his supporting company
the director will now be forced to consider
the type and characteristics of the “star,”
and if the latter be gifted with “temperament,”
the days following are likely to be
anything but pleasant. One of the classics
of studio history tells of a famous actress,
probably one of the best known in America,
who was engaged to appear in a picture to
be made abroad to secure the correct atmosphere.
The company planned to produce
the picture in six weeks, but the leading
woman’s uncontrollable disposition held up
the work until six months were actually expended
on the undertaking. Petty fits of
temper caused this actress to refuse to appear
before the camera for days in succession,
while at other times she would abandon the
work in the middle of a scene, and scarce a
move was made that was not preceded by
a wordy argument with the director. But,
while comparatively common a few years
ago, such occurrences are now very rare,
with the dividing line between players of the
screen and stage not so sharply drawn.</p>

<p>Several preliminary details still await the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>director. A “scene plot” must be laid out,
to let the studio carpenter know what settings
will be required by the story, and a list of
furnishings and small articles necessary is
prepared for the “property-man.” Most
directors will now read the complete story
to the principal players, both that they may
understand the action and to allow them to
make preparations for the different costumes
they will need. A decision will also be made
at this time on the particular places that
will be used for the exterior scenes. The directors
study closely the country around
their studios, and some even make use of
card indexes to catalogue the spots that may
be used at some future time as backgrounds
for picture scenes. A house of quaint Colonial
architecture, a picturesque brook, or a
winding road shaded with stately trees, all
will find their place in the director’s list, for
who knows what scenery his next story may
call for?</p>

<p>I know you are impatient to have the
camera set up, and to see the action of the
photoplay begin. But one more preliminary
decision remains for the director before he
can do this. He must prepare his “working
script,” which will outline the order in which
he is to produce the different scenes of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>story. It is a surprise to most laymen to
learn that the scenes in a motion picture are
not taken consecutively as they appear on
the screen. This would appear to be the
more logical and artistic method, but a little
investigation will show that this is not practicable.
Take, for instance, a story in which
a hotel lobby scene appears many times.
Were the picture taken in the order in which
it is seen when completed the expense on
this scene would be repeated several times,
since it would be necessary to rebuild the
hotel lobby each time the director came to
that particular scene in his story, or else use
up valuable studio floor space for an idle set
while waiting for the director to reach the
point where the scene was required again.
On the other hand, under the method actually
followed, when the hotel lobby is constructed
the players can, with little loss of
time, go through the different bits of action
taking place in this setting. Later, when the
film is developed, these scenes will be arranged
in their proper place in the story.</p>

<p>Many considerations will be weighed by
the director in making up his mind as to the
order in which he will take his scenes. The
weather, of course, is an important factor in
coming to a decision as to whether he will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>first take his “interiors,” that is, scenes
taken in the studio, or the “exteriors,” the
action photographed outdoors. Usually the
more simple scenes will be taken first, and the
elaborate and costly ones last, this to forestall
prohibitive expense should minor
changes be made in the story while the
picture is being produced. Such changes
are not infrequent, for a director will often
see ways to strengthen his story while the
players are enacting it before his eyes.</p>

<p>We are ready to start to work. It is nine
<span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, or perhaps even earlier, for the picture
producer does not care to lose any more
of the precious daylight than he has to. This
is one of the biggest surprises of screen work
to the player from the stage. He is accustomed
to matinée performances at two in
the afternoon, twice a week, but as a usual
thing his work is from eight to eleven in the
evening. His life is run after the sun has set.
Then he enters the picture field and finds it
an “early to bed and early to rise” game.
Healthful days in the open of green fields
and country roads replace the stuffy stage,
and even the studio is freedom when compared
with the theater. It is the zest and
regularity of picture life; yes, even the necessity
of awakening early in the morning, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>causes so many players from the stage to
take it up permanently. There is the real
home life of the ordinary professional man,
instead of the weary traveling and “one-night
stands,” and there is employment
fifty-two weeks in the year in place of the
short season and long lay-off of the theater.</p>

THE DIRECTOR—HIS CAMERA AND CAMERA-MAN</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The sun is shining clearly and the director
plans a long day of work in the open. Besides,
the studio stages are all in use by directors
who have put in their requisitions far
in advance. The camera-man and his apparatus,
players, and director jump into autos
and speed to the first “location.” With his
assistant the director has mapped the locations
and the order of photographing the
scenes there as already explained. His first
location is a suburban home, one that may
be labeled in his catalogue as “home of a
fairly wealthy family.” A caretaker is in
charge and the director knows—from experience—that
a few cigars, or, if the house is
especially necessary, a greenback, will enable
him to use it for picture-taking purposes.
We will say that the scenes are to show a thief
entering the house and later leaving it with
his booty. In the story this is probably to
happen at night, but tinting the film blue
will later attend to that.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>
<p>Perhaps there is a tall fence around the
grounds, and one of the director’s scenes will
have to show the thief climbing this obstacle,
both on his entry into the grounds, and later
on his escape. Perhaps, with the latter,
there is to be a brief scuffle with the watchman.
A spot for the scene is chosen, the
camera set up, and all is ready. The range
of vision of the camera’s eye, the lens, is an
angle, and care is taken to indicate to the
players the boundaries of that angle. Outside
those lines the players may group themselves
idly, but within the lines the camera
registers everything, once the crank is turning.
The first scene taken is to show the thief
scaling the fence. The player is rehearsed
once or twice, perhaps even oftener, until he
does the action in the exact way the director
wishes it done. When he is proficient the
director stations himself beside the camera-man,
the scene is cleared, and the thief stands
waiting just outside the line. “One—two—three—Go!”
shouts the director, and at his
last word the thief skulks on the scene, the
camera-man starts to turn the crank. The
thief peers through the fence, glances furtively
about him, and then, as if making a
sudden decision, starts to climb. He drops
to the ground on the other side, then runs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>diagonally until he is again outside the camera
line. It is over. During the whole the director
has been the busiest man on the spot.
Each motion of the player has been accompanied
by a command from him, but it is not
for the player to let the camera know that he
is listening for these words. By holding a
slate covered with figures in front of the
camera before the scene was photographed
this strip of film now bears its own index
figure to aid the factory later in assembling
the complete picture.</p>

<p>Next, the scene showing the return of the
thief over the fence, his scuffle with the watchman,
and his escape is to be taken. This will
probably require many more rehearsals than
the previous scene, both that the action be
properly vigorous and realistic, and that the
players be drilled so that they will not inadvertently
cross the camera lines in the heat
of the action. An audience would naturally
not take very kindly to a scene in which a
man was fighting with an adversary who
could not be seen, which would be the case
should one of the players step outside the
lines while the other remained in view of the
camera. It is even possible that many strips
of film will be wasted before the scene is
taken in a manner to satisfy the director.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>
<p>Now we pass within the grounds. There
is a brief scene to be taken as the thief starts
to climb the wall on making his escape, and
also the short one showing him running across
the lawn to the house. He is to make his
entry by way of a window, and the camera is
placed so as to view the one chosen. The
same procedure is followed here—numbering
of the scene, rehearsals, including a preliminary
timing of the action so that the director
will know how many feet of film it will take,
and then photographing, after which preparations
are made for the next scene. The
director and his players may easily put in a
busy day about the house. There will be
scenes showing detectives, summoned by the
householder, examining the grounds, the
watchman hastening up to the front door
after he has recovered from the blow inflicted
by the thief, and so on. When the
sun finally gets too low for the camera’s
liking it will be a tired but contented party
that returns to the studio.</p>

<p>This is but one side of the story. Much
has also happened within the house. Though
recently perfected portable lighting systems
have made it possible to take motion pictures
within actual houses, the method is only occasionally
used, and our director will probably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>decide to take all his interiors in the
studio. On his return from the day of work
outdoors he will leave his requisitions with
the carpenter and property-man and be prepared
to start early the next morning with
his scenes set and all other things ready.
Then the thief’s entry into the window, as
seen from inside the house, his theft of the
jewels, we will say, his departure, the householders
aroused from their sleep by the watchman,
and their consternation at the discovery
of the theft will all be photographed. Pieced
together and shown on the screen, the various
strips of film will tell a smoothly developed
story, but we have seen how it is really made
up of little bits of action, photographed at
different times, and in far from consecutive
order. We have seen what a world of planning
the director must do before he sets out
to make even the simplest scene of his story.</p>

</div>

STAGING A SPECTACULAR BATTLE SCENE</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But we have been watching the director
while he is working on dramatic scenes that
employ only a few players, of whose ability
he is certain. Perhaps he has a ball-room
scene to take with his interiors, and then there
is a busy time indeed ahead of him. He must
drill and toil with fifty or a hundred “extras”
drafted from the outside and receiving only
a few dollars for the day’s work. Or else one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>of his exteriors may call for a player to jump
from a bridge. The leading woman will not
perform this feat; she is too careful of her
own life. So a “double” must be employed—a
daredevil of about the same build as the
leading woman, and to be dressed in the same
clothes. The leading woman will perform the
scene until about the point where she leans
over the railing preparatory to the fatal leap.
Then the camera will be moved to a distant
point, and, too far away for the deception
to be noted, the “double” will make the thrilling
jump. If there is to be a rescue the leading
lady will now get herself wet, as we are
given close views showing her being pulled
from the water, apparently near death from
her feat. For such “stunts” as even a daredevil
cannot be employed to perform, the
property-room may make dummies, “rags
and bones and hanks of hair,” weighted with
sand. Then there are the more spectacular
scenes that may test a director’s skill, such
as battles, fires, and so on. Here he must
fortify himself with numbers of trusted assistants,
who, dressed like those in the scene,
will be scattered among the “extras” where
the voice of the director often cannot reach.
Hours, and even days, of rehearsal are sometimes
necessary in securing such effects. For
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>the battle scenes in “The Birth of a Nation”
the producer surrounded himself with a corps
of assistants equal to a commanding general’s
staff. In addition telephones were strung
along to all the trenches so that the producer
was in touch with every section of the vast
battle-field at all times.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE FACTORY</p>


<p>The average amateur photographer, who
has made a practice of developing and
printing his own photographs, will find little
of interest in a description of the stages
through which the film passes in a motion-picture
factory. It is essentially the same
process that he follows, though, naturally,
on a much larger scale and making use of
all the mechanical appliances possible. The
variations in the chemical formulas used
are those which the studious amateur’s own
judgment would dictate to him were he
working under conditions similar to those
of the motion-picture photographer.</p>

<p>His day’s work completed, the camera-man
takes his negative film, which is contained
in the take-up box of the camera to
protect it from the light, to the factory. The
film taken from the camera now faces the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>following steps: the development, washing,
and, finally, fixing, thus producing a “negative”
from which the “positive” prints used
for exhibition purposes are to be made. The
development of the negative takes place, of
course, in a “dark room,” that is, dark in
the photographic sense, the sole illumination
being that of lamps providing a pure red
light. The negative strips are wound spirally
about pins on a rectangular rack, thus
making it possible to wet the entire surface
of the film simultaneously and equally when
the rack is submerged in the developing
solution.</p>

<p>Metal and hydroquinine are the chemical
agents most active in the developing solution
most commonly used, soda sulphite, soda
carbonate, potassium, metabisulphite, and
water completing the formula. But even for
standard work there are varieties of developing-baths,
while to handle film taken under
out-of-the-ordinary conditions still further
changes are made. It is in his ability to meet
varying circumstances that the factory executive
shows his mettle. Test developments
may be made on a few inches of film to indicate
the exact process to be followed. The
washing of the film, and its submersion in
the “fixing”-bath are the next items, also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>familiar to the ordinary photographer. The
“fixing”—that is, submersion in a solution
of sodium hyposulphite—renders the negative
immune to the light, after which it
is once more washed, this time to remove
the “hypo” of the fixing-bath. The negative
may now be treated with a diluted
solution of glycerine, which renders it soft
and pliable, for there is much wear in store
for this negative.</p>

<p>We have seen previously how each scene
taken during the day was numbered to aid
the producer in assembling the picture in
the proper order. The negative strips are
now assembled in a complete strip and
viewed by the executives of the company
before the first positive print is made. This
initial inspection will, like as not, show that
some of the scenes must be retaken, either because
of poor photography or for some other
reason not noticed by the director at the time
the original scene was taken. “Retakes”
are, naturally, not popular with the men who
pay the bills, though they are often due to
natural causes beyond the power of the director
or camera-man to forestall. As picture
producers always take a good deal
more film than will be used in the subject
shown later in the theaters, this viewing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>of the negative will also aid in bringing
the picture down to the required size and
in deciding on the printed inserts needed,
though it is also probable that a good deal
of cutting, reassembling, titling, and so on,
will be done after the first positive print is
made.</p>

<p>The negative approved, we are now ready
to print the positives. On the negative, as
the amateur photographer will know, the
light conditions were reversed from the normal.
That is, the portions of the film which
we would expect to appear white, such as a
snow-covered walk, were black, while the
dark portions, a railroad train, for example,
appeared white. This is the principle explaining
the method of printing positives.
The negative is superimposed on the positive
film stock and light allowed to stream
through. Naturally the image on the negative
obstructs light in proportion to its density.
Our snow-bank, let us say, being black
on the negative, will allow no light to pass
through and that portion of the positive
stock under it will not be exposed. The
near-by train, appearing white on the negative,
offers no obstruction to the light, and
here the positive is strongly exposed. When
the positive is later developed it takes on a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>deposit of silver in equal proportion to
the strength of the exposure, the snow-bank
taking little, while a heavy deposit of silver
clings to that part of the film showing the
railroad train, which received so much exposure
to the light. Thus the positive
print brings the light conditions back to
normal again, the train appears dark, the
snow white, and the other objects in the scene
shaded in ratio to the amount of light they
allowed to penetrate through the negative to
the positive stock.</p>

<p>In practice positive printing is done by a
machine using for its essential principles the
shutter and feeding devices that we have
seen in the motion-picture camera. Negative
and positive stock are perforated alike, and
when superimposed the perforations fall in
alignment. The film-feeding device of the
printer engages in these perforations just
as we saw it do in the camera, only in this
case it is moving the negative and positive
film along simultaneously. What would be
the lens in the camera is here the place where
the light is allowed to pass through. Once
more the shutter serves its purpose of shutting
off the light while the required length
of film for one small picture is shifted into
place. As in the camera, care is taken that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>the light strikes no portion of the film but
the three-quarter-inch strip that is being
exposed. The action of a printer is practically
automatic, but the human touch
is evident in determining the brilliancy of
the light, its distance from the film, and
the speed at which the printer will be run,
all points determined by the condition of the
negative.</p>

</div>

DRYING-ROOM IN THE FACTORY—THE FILM IS WOUND ON THE LARGE DRUMS</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The developing of positive film is a process
much similar to that we have just described
for the negative film. The chemicals
used in the formulas are much the same,
though the proportions vary. As positive
film is less sensitive to light than negative,
the developing need not be done in a dark
room, though even here daylight, or the
“yellow” light of the common electric bulb,
is not permissible. To the eye positive and
negative film appear much alike, and, in
truth, they differ only slightly to render them
more adaptable to their different uses. The
drying of both positive and negative film,
following the various operations, is accomplished
by means of large drums, on which
hundreds of feet may be wound.</p>

<p>The picture producer may now decide to
tint some portions of his film and to tone
others. Tinting is nothing more than giving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>the film a bath of dye; toning is a chemical
process by which the dark portions of a picture
are intensified and given certain color
tones, while the high lights are not affected.
Though photography at night is now attempted
very frequently, tinting is the means
more commonly employed to give the impression
of action taking place at night.
Toning does not appear so artificial as tinting,
since it does not affect the high lights,
and an artistic director may easily arrange
his scene so that the coloring appears natural
on those parts that are affected. The
toning of film is accomplished by placing it
in chemicals which affect the silver deposits
on the surface, permanently changing its
color. Where there is no silver deposit, as,
for instance, in the snow-bank we have so
often mentioned, there would be no change.
The process of fixing follows.</p>

<p>It might be well to explain here the usual
method of photographing subtitles and other
explanatory reading-matter in a picture.
This is done by means of an ordinary camera
using glass plates, which points downward
at the subtitle, which is in white letters on a
black background. What is known as a
“plate-printer” is then used to put this impression
on the positive motion-picture film.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>In this process the transparent negative of
the subtitle secured on the glass plate is
placed in a cabinet between a condenser lens
and a smaller projecting lens. Before this
small lens there is a film-gate, the positive
film being fed into it in the same manner
that we have seen employed in the camera
and the positive-printer for ordinary work.
Thus when the light passes through the condenser
and the negative of the subtitle, the
small lens casts a reduced image of it on the
small bit of positive film passing before the
gate. In ordinary printing of motion-picture
film negative and positive are superimposed
and passed before a light; in this
case the image cast by the small lens takes
the place of the negative film, but the principle
is the same.</p>

<p>The factories of motion-picture plants must
be as delicately handled as any piece of intricate
machinery. The temperatures of the
various rooms, and also of the chemical baths
used in the different processes, must be kept
constant at certain points. Dust must be
conspicuous by its absence, for the slightest
particle of foreign matter may scratch and
otherwise harm valuable film. The water
used in the factory is an important item, and
in cases where the regular supply has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>shown to be inferior by chemical analysis,
picture companies have often gone to the
expense of drilling artesian wells to secure a
pure supply. This was one of the moves
made at a factory near Philadelphia, which
boasts of its ability to turn out six million
feet of positive film each week. Though most
motion pictures made in the United States
are produced in California, practically all of
the factory work is done in the East. This
is largely due to the fact that New York is
the distributing point and business center.
Not all of the companies known for their
film productions have developing and printing
plants. Many of the factories do the
mechanical work for numerous other firms.
In addition there are scores of companies
doing only factory work and staging no pictures
of their own.</p>

<p>The picture is now all but ready for the
market. Most of the directors take part in
the assembling stage when the film is cut to
its proper length, the subtitles inserted, and
the finishing touches applied that make the
picture ready to meet the eyes of the outside
world. This is indeed one of the most important
stages in the making of a picture,
for here the work of the best of directors may
easily be unalterably ruined, or, perhaps,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>a poorly staged picture made into a passable
or even good one.</p>

<p>It is an impossibility for a director in staging
a picture to photograph just the amount
of film that will be required for the production
that is offered to the public. In the
first place, even the most experienced of
picture-men cannot hope to accurately estimate
the amount of film that will be needed
to portray certain actions; and secondly, a
director will often find, when he has his players
working before the camera, that a certain
scene is worthy of more space than originally
planned for in the script. So that, even after
throwing out the scenes that were spoiled
for one reason or other, there is still some
paring to be done before the picture is cut
to the length that the film editor thinks the
subject worth and the business office says
is most likely to be profitable. Commercial
reasons still demand, for instance, that pictures
consist of a certain number of full
reels, each containing approximately one
thousand feet. If the film editor finds that
his picture is at its best at five thousand three
hundred feet he faces the unwelcome task of
cutting three hundred more feet, though
each scene now in the picture may appear
to him essential. Natural-length pictures,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>which would run the exact length demanded
by the story, with the remainder of the reel,
if necessary, filled out with an appropriate
short picture, are frequently seen, and their
advocates are many. But they are not in
strong favor commercially.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE BUSINESS SIDE</p>


<p>The business organization of the motion-picture
field can find no counterpart
in any other line of commercial activity.
In some of its aspects it is akin to the theatrical
world, in others it resembles publishing,
but there are many points distinctly unique.
The commercial organization is an evolution
peculiarly adapted to picture conditions,
and it is still in a state of transition, continuous
and even more radical than that evident
in the producing methods.</p>

<p>In its most interesting feature the system
used in the United States resembles the newspaper
syndicate, through which an article
is published simultaneously all over the
country in dozens of newspapers. In this
case the article is supplied to the different
newspapers in advance, with the statement
that it is “released” on a certain date;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>that is, the newspaper may publish it on and
after that particular date, but not before.
This explains the surprise of the young man
who travels away from home for the first
time when he finds that the newspapers of
the city he is visiting carry many of the
special features he reads in the papers at
his home city, and that they publish the articles
simultaneously. In a similar manner
motion pictures are shipped far in advance
to the exchanges, the local distributing agents.
A certain “release” date has been chosen,
and on that day the picture is shown for the
first time in theaters throughout the country.
New York, in the heart of the film world,
thus boasts of no advantage over the city a
thousand miles away. The use of the word
“release” in this connection is similar to
that in the newspaper syndicate field, which
explains a point that invariably proves confusing
to the layman seeking information
in filmland.</p>

<p>We are told in the chapter dealing with the
history of the motion picture of the formation
of the first large distributing organization.
The system followed by this combination
will give an idea of the method employed
by the older organizations in handling the
short pictures that make up the bulk of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>film output. In forming the combination
a group of pioneer picture manufacturers
bound themselves together to release their
product to the theater-owners through the
one channel. Exchanges are located in the
principal cities of the country and the distributing
organization purchases from the
manufacturer the number of positive prints
of each picture needed to supply these exchanges.
A manufacturer’s popularity with
the exhibitors and the public is shown, of
course, by the number of positive prints that
the distributor must purchase from him to
meet the demand. These manufacturers
profited both by the sale of their prints
and, through their direct interest in the distributor,
from the earnings of the latter.
There are two other large distributing agents
organized along the lines of the pioneer to
handle the output of other manufacturers.
In the one the union between producer and
distributor is not as close as that of the
pioneer, while in the other producer and distributor
are practically identical.</p>

<p>From these distributing agents the theater-owner
secures his program, the usual practice
being to pay a stated weekly rental price,
dependent on the number of reels he secures
and their freshness. The exhibitor who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>shows the pictures on the day they are released
naturally pays a proportionately larger
rental for this “first-run” privilege than
the theater-owner who is satisfied with pictures
that may be days or weeks old. The
latter runs the risk of showing pictures that
his patrons have already seen in other
theaters, and, naturally, he must expect
film that has received the wear and tear of
many performances since the day it was released.</p>

<p>This method sufficed for the short picture,
but the coming of the feature, a production
of three or more reels, changed matters considerably.
It brought a score of independent
producers into the field, and these men set
about seeking their own methods of marketing.
The first step was the development of “state
rights” buyers, usually independent exchange
owners who bid for the exclusive rights to
handle the feature productions in their territories.
The producer sold the rights and
the necessary positive prints for the different
territories to the highest bidders, and after
that he washed his hands of the production,
though, of course, he still had the negative,
should additional positive prints be needed.
The purchaser of the “state rights” was now
in absolute control of the picture in his territory.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>His income was secured by renting
the picture to the theater-owners.</p>

<p>“State rights” are at present heard of
only seldom; they have been succeeded by
the “feature program,” a combination of
manufacturers of long pictures similar in
many ways to the older combinations of the
producers of short pictures. The chief advantage
of the feature program lies in its
certainty. To the theater-owner it offers an
assurance of a steady supply of pictures of a
certain quality, and in addition he knows the
pictures that he will show far enough in advance
to properly advertise them. To the
picture producer the feature program offers
a steady market, with an income that he can
estimate, and thus he is enabled to make
greater expenditures on each picture and to
plan more extensively for the future than
would be the case were each production to
be sold separately.</p>

<p>Each of the feature programs has its
own type of organization. Some are practically
closed corporations handling only the
productions of a certain group of manufacturers.
Others are comparatively elastic
in their organization, and, while releasing
all the productions of certain manufacturers,
will also contract to handle the pictures made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>by independent workers. The manufacturer
usually receives his income from the
feature program through a percentage of
the rental earnings of his pictures. In the
case of distributors who sign monthly or
yearly contracts with exhibitors to supply
them with a stated number of pictures each
week it can be seen that the manufacturer’s
return will be almost a constant figure, affected
only slightly by the merits of the individual
picture. This is, in fact, one of the
most important defects of the closely bound
program, it tends to place all the pictures
on a common level. While this may work to
the producer’s advantage in the case of a poor
picture, he also finds it irksome when he
attempts to secure the proper return from a
picture that cost him an unusually large
amount to produce. The feature program
that secures its income from the per diem
rentals of each picture, with no long-term
contracts to fall back upon, is a trifle more
elastic.</p>

<p>We now come to the latest step in the evolution
of the business side of the motion
picture. This is, in many ways, a return to
the methods of the theatrical producer. The
manufacturers found that they could not
expect to secure a reasonable profit from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>pictures that cost extra-large sums of money
and many months of preparation if they
were marketed through the ordinary channels.
So they resolved to take a leaf from the stage
producer’s book and turn exhibitors themselves.
With such productions as “The
Birth of a Nation” the manufacturer handles
the presentation himself in the large cities,
and the picture, like the spoken play, is
presented as long as it attracts patrons.
If the picture succeeds, an engagement to
packed houses of many weeks, or even
months, is assured, so that it can be seen
that the manufacturer’s profits are tremendous.
Different methods are used following
the metropolitan engagements. Sometimes
the manufacturer will sell the rights to the
territory he has not touched, just as in the
old days he sold “state rights.” Or perhaps
he will send out many different prints of the
picture to tour the country under his own
management in the same manner that the
theatrical manager sends out a number of
companies to present the piece that has succeeded
in New York. The original company
will be seen only in New York, and possibly
Chicago and a few other large cities, while
the other companies will tour the “one-night
stands,” up and down the map. Just as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>prestige of success in New York aids a play,
so it also proves valuable to a picture.</p>

<p>The earnings of a motion-picture production
are as fluctuating as the rise and fall of
stock prices in Wall Street. The cost of a
thousand-foot picture is usually placed at
the average of a thousand dollars, and the
manufacturer selling his positive prints at
ten cents a foot and releasing through established
channels markets twenty-five prints,
though the number may run many more or
less, according to the efficiency of the selling
organization and the popularity of the particular
type of picture. He may thus be
seen to have more than doubled his investment.
His foreign sales may double this
figure again. But this instance treats of
the manufacturer who has been years in
business, and who is releasing through one
of the combinations strong enough to practically
guarantee a market. Even in these
cases inferior-quality pictures or a change in
the tastes of the public may quickly force a
drop in the number of prints sold. Likewise
it does not require a very great increase in
the cost of production to eat up the profit.</p>

<p>The manufacturer of long pictures faces
even greater uncertainty. His investment in
each picture will average between ten and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>twenty-five thousand dollars, and it does
not require many high-salaried stars or spectacular
scenes to reach the higher figure.
Nor have we considered the overhead expense
of maintaining a studio and offices and
the heavy outlay to market the picture.
A poor picture can lose all of the original investment
and even more, the latter if a
strenuous effort is made by means of advertising
and so on to sell it. A good picture
can double the investment, and the outlook
for a picture of unusual strength is rosy indeed.
Many very costly productions have
been forgotten a month after they were released;
many very good pictures are still
earning money for their producers two and
three years after they first came on the market.
The life of the negative is without limit,
and after the original investment has been
recovered, the cost of supplying new positive
prints for those that have worn out is a small
item.</p>

<p>Theater-owners who show the long-feature
productions pay an average of fifty dollars
per day for the rental. If competition is
strong between the producers the price may
go lower, and long-term contracts to use the
output of certain organizations may also
make the cost of his pictures less to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>theater-owner. But frequently he will pay
more than this sum for the picture that has
proven its popularity. The theater using
short pictures—showing three or more subjects
at a performance—contracts for its
service at a stated weekly rental price, ranging
from fifty dollars to two hundred and
fifty dollars or more. For the top-notch
price he will receive “first-run” pictures, that
is, pictures he is allowed to show on the day
of release. For the intermediate price his
program will be varied; it is apt to include
one “first-run” picture, one week-old subject,
and others that have been released a greater
length of time.</p>

<p class="ph3">PRACTICAL HINTS ON PHOTOPLAY-WRITING</p>


<p>In a preceding chapter we have endeavored
to drive home what we conceive to be
the first and most important lesson in the
art of photoplay-writing; that is, a respect
for the work and willingness to devote serious
attention and study it. Regardless of
what the correspondence-school advertisements
say, writing photoplays is no easy
task, and selling them a still more difficult
one. The screen is not a retreat for hackneyed,
broken-down plots that failed of a
sale everywhere else, nor is it likely to pay
you for the idea that you dash off in a few
idle moments. True enough, you can see
many mediocre stories, many trashy ones,
when you attend the picture theater, but the
aspirant for success should not take the worst
specimens for his ideal. It is bad enough for
the staff writer to be forced to turn out such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>material to keep step with the swift pace of
production, but the fact that he can do it so
much easier than the outsider means that
the latter’s efforts must be top-notch to bring
forth the welcome check that comes with
acceptance.</p>

<p>The would-be photoplaywright must first
undergo a process of self-examination. He
must be certain that he possesses the power
of observation that enables him to see the
germs of stories in the little incidents that
would ordinarily be passed by with scarce a
moment’s thought. He must be gifted with
the imagination that will enable him to create
a full-bodied story—a plot—from this germ.
Lastly, he must possess the story-telling
ability, or, more properly for photoplay-writing,
the knowledge of dramatic principles
necessary to relate his story in such
a manner that the interest of his audience
mounts steadily and is held to the end.
These qualities the beginner must have
at the outset. He can learn later the possibilities
and limitations of the silent drama
by studying the pictures in the theaters.
Likewise, by imitation of a sample form he
can learn how to prepare his manuscript in
the correct technical form.</p>

<p>Let us take up in greater detail the necessary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>qualities that we have enumerated.
We will imagine that you have pencil and
paper before you and have set out to write
a photoplay. Your brain is barren of ideas,
but you can’t afford to wait for an inspiration;
you might sit there all day, chewing
the end of your pencil, before a plot-germ
would come to you out of the empty air.
But there is your note-book—first aid to the
power of observation—let’s see if there is
anything there to jog the imagination. Turning
the pages of the note-book, you see brief
jottings that represent weeks of observation.
Here is a note prompted by a newspaper account
of a train hold up in which the lone
bandit blunderingly made away with the
mail-bag, leaving thousands of dollars in
currency untouched. The newspapers said
the laugh was on the robber, but as you read
the thought flashed through your mind,
“Supposing a fugitive from justice, wrongfully
accused, knew that in the mail carried
by this train there was a letter concerning
the condition of his wife who was critically
ill back East, and that he braved arrest and
possible death, not for money, but because
of the strength of his love?”</p>

<p>There are possibilities in that idea, but
somehow or other, as you revolve it in your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>mind now, your enthusiasm does not increase.
For one thing, you know that newspaper accounts
are dangerous bits of inspiration.
Possibly fifty or a hundred other photoplay
writers in all parts of the country have read
the same story, followed similar lines of
thought, and are about to write stories with
this as the central idea. The staff writers
have also seized upon it. Then, again, the
only plots your imagination gives you to
build around the idea are trite and ordinary.
So you decide to let this plot-germ rest in
the note-book until some future moment,
when another jotting, or perhaps a bit of
happy inspiration, will give you the material
to make a strong, original story out of it.</p>

<p>Over the pages of the note-book you go
again. There are accounts of humorous little
incidents that you witnessed or heard about,
and which will one day furnish inspiration
for comedies. There are notes concerning
unusual faces, features that, to an observant
eye, seem to be pregnant with stories. A
two-line note may describe the odd-looking
house you saw on your walk last Sunday
that brought to mind visions of ghosts and
goblins. This is what we mean by the power
of observation. Without it you cannot hope
to succeed as an author, for there is no such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>thing as inspiration <i>per se</i>; observation is
the seed of inspiration. Cultivate this power,
use your note-book, never lose a moment in
search of an idea, spend your time developing
the plot-germs that you have found at the
best of sources—real life.</p>

<p>“The ability to create a plot from this
idea,” we have stated as the second important
quality. “Plot”—there is the stumbling-block
that halts the majority of beginners.
“The biggest defect of the plays submitted
by outsiders,” says Lawrence McCloskey, a
photoplay editor who has handled thousands
of such manuscripts, “is that they do not
contain real plots. They are usually abstract
incidents, more or less interesting, but without
complications sufficient to hold the attention
of an audience. Or else they are in
the nature of long histories, telling the life
stories of their characters, without definite
beginning, climax, or ending.”</p>

<p>What is plot? In Editor McCloskey’s
sentence you have the outlines of a definition.
It is not an abstract incident, or even
a series of such incidents. It is a story woven
around a central theme, which is usually a
crisis in the lives of the characters. It has
a definite beginning, which is at the time when
the causes are born which gradually increase
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>in strength and at the last give rise to the
events which produce the climax, the height
of the suspense and interest. It has a definite
ending, which should come as soon as it has
been determined whether the crisis overwhelms
the characters or whether they pass
through it successfully. The ideal plot is the
plot of struggle, whether physical or mental.
The struggle may be that of two men for
the favor of a girl, a poor man against starvation,
an avaricious one for wealth, or it
may be the struggle of a woman to keep
steadfast her faith in a worthless husband.
The climax is the point at which the struggle
becomes most bitter, the outcome of which
is to decide whether the characters win or
lose in their fight against odds. The climax
may be in sight to the audience soon after
the beginning; in fact, a grouping of the
early incidents so that the audience fears
the climax produces suspense, but the outcome,
the author’s solution of his climax,
must be in doubt. Or, if it be sensed by
the audience, the means by which he is to
bring it about must be the author’s secret
until he is ready to say the word. There
are students who go further in the analysis
of the subdivisions of a plot, and in dividing
the different types, but the beginner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>who uses this definition as a test of his stories
will not go wrong.</p>

<p>We will go back to the note-book and seek
an idea that may be developed into a plot.
Here is a hastily made note written to remind
you of a pathetic face: “The wrinkled
old woman and the worried-looking daughter
who come to the post-office every day.”
“Aha,” you say. “Here is a ready-made
plot. I’ll have them coming to the post-office
in search of a letter from a wandering
son. They are in poverty, and just as they
are about to be turned out of their home I’ll
have the son return laden with wealth.”
Beware of the ready-made plot! The studio
mails are full of them, but no checks are drawn
to pay the authors. The judge who condemns
his own son, the little child who reforms the
burglar, the upright district attorney who
defies his sweetheart’s father, the political
boss, all these are old friends of the photoplay
editors. “But,” you say, “I saw one
of these same stories on the screen only a
few days ago.” Perhaps you did, but think
it over. Wasn’t there something else besides
this bare idea, wasn’t there some new
twist, some original turn that lent it freshness
and almost made you forget how old
the plot-basis was? Let’s see if we can’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>take the idea about the old woman and daughter
at the post-office and give it a new guise.
And before we start to mold our plot remember
that we can’t compel the characters
to do what we want them to do; we must
give them a reason for every action. In real
life people do not do things without a motive
or an impelling cause, but many photoplay
authors would seem to think that the
fact that the author wanted his characters to
perform a certain action is sufficient excuse
for it. To check up: Originality and consistency
are all-important. Seek a fresh viewpoint,
but when you get something new remember
that it must be logical, let it not
insult the intelligence of the audience.</p>

<p>Starting out, then, we need a reason for
the son going away from home. Suppose we
change the young woman’s status and make
her, not the daughter, but the girl who was
to have married the son. They quarreled,
she broke the engagement, and in a state
of mingled temper and despair he ran away.
Soon after his departure the mother is injured
in an accident and her sight destroyed.
Blaming her pride for the son’s leaving home,
the young woman takes upon her shoulders
the care of the mother. The son takes to
drink and roistering companions; he descends
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>lower and lower in the scale until finally he
is a besotted tramp. We now have our characters
drawn; we have a reason for the son’s
action in leaving home, an “excuse” for his
long absence and apparent indifference to
what is happening there, and a motive for
the girl in seeking to make the mother happy.</p>

<p>All well enough. We have our characters,
but we are still far from having a story.
An audience might be mildly interested in
such people, but there would be no gripping
suspense, no desire to know more concerning
them. There would be no “doubt as to outcome”
because from all appearances the
lives of the characters are to continue in the
same channel. We want “complications,”
but don’t go after them like the average beginner
and throw in action and befuddling
incidents just for the sake of mixing things
up until you are ready to have the son return
home. And don’t fall back on the trite
story we have already discarded—the mother
in poverty and the son returning in time to
save her. Let’s see: Mother and sweetheart
are hoping for the son’s return, the audience
expects to see him back. Can’t we introduce
some element that would make his return
also a cause for fear? Steer clear of that
thought that tells you, “He went away
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>charged with a crime, and he will brave arrest
to come back to his dying mother’s bedside.”
The audience knows that story too
well. We have it! When the mother met
with the accident the doctors despaired of
her life. To make her last few weeks of life
more happy the girl concocted imaginary
letters from the son saying that he was prospering
in a distant country. Later, when
death seemed near, to cheer the mother and
strengthen her faith in her boy the girl’s
letters told of his efforts to return home,
though the means of travel were difficult.
But finicky fate ruled that the mother,
though still blind, should recover her health,
and the girl has been forced to continue the
deception. Now the surgeon holds out hope
that within a few months the mother’s eyesight
may be restored. Here we have complications
and suspense galore. Any way
out seems to lead to trouble worse than any
which our characters have yet encountered.</p>

<p>We are nearing the climax, and you will
find that long ago the plot has taken the
reins into its own hands; it needs no more
spurring. Through the rooms of the darkened
house there one day sounds the mother’s
cry, “I see! I see!” After the first glad embrace
of the girl her cry is for her son’s letters.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>Desperate, the girl urges her to wait
until the morrow, after the surgeon has said
that she may read. While the mother is protesting
the girl suddenly tears herself away
and flees hysterically from the house. She
walks blindly down the hillside to the railroad
tracks, then throws herself down on the
grass to weep. She hears voices. Peering
through a near-by bush, she sees a gathering
of tramps hovering over a fire, a whisky-bottle
passing around the circle. Frightened,
she turns to run, but a slight noise betrays
her, and the tramps, drink-crazed, start after
her. All but one run only a few steps, but
this one, more daring than the rest, continues
the pursuit. She stumbles and he comes
upon her. With a despairing scream she
turns to look into his leering face, and—it is
the son and sweetheart.</p>

<p>There is your climax. End your story in
any one of the many ways that are possible,
but, above all, end it quickly. It is a wise
author who knows when his story is done.
Withstand the temptation to start another
story at the point where this one ends. You
do not have to follow your characters to
the grave; the interest of the audience is
over when the crisis is past. You may spoil
the effect of a good story by trifling with its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>interest after that. That is part of the story-teller’s
art that we spoke of as the third essential—the
ability to know where to begin
the story, so that no time is lost in useless
detail, while at the same time making the
necessary points clear, a knowledge of what
incidents to introduce and how to group them
so that they merge smoothly into the climax
and the gift of stopping when the story is
done.</p>

<p>Thus far our talk has been on points that
might apply with almost equal force to any
line of literary endeavor. Let us now take
up some points more closely identified with
the photoplay. We have learned how to
look for ideas, we have seen how a plot is
built; now we must find out how to tell our
story on the screen. It should be unnecessary
to tell aspirants that since all photoplays
are told by means of pantomime, “action”
is a prime necessity. The audience
wants to see the characters do everything
worth while in the story. It feels cheated
if you insert a subtitle saying, “Helen
loves John because he saved her from death
in a factory fire.” The screen’s purpose is
to show the fire, to show John performing
his heroic deed. No matter how good your
story is, if it is of such a type that it cannot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>be “acted out,” then it does not belong on
the screen. Printed inserts are unwelcome
necessities—they are not the substance of
which the motion picture’s popularity is
made. Cultivate the “picture eye,” the
faculty of visualizing each incident in your
story, to discover if it is possible of being explained
to an audience by means of action
without the aid of words.</p>

<p>Make each scene tell its own story, either
by carrying the action of the whole a step
further, or by giving an insight into the
character of a person important in the story.
For instance, instead of the bald statement,
“John Jenks is a crusty old bachelor,” why
not a scene showing Jenks in his home irascibly
ordering his servants about?—let the
audience see for itself the type of man he is.
Have your scenes follow one another logically,
but—here the printed insert shows its usefulness—don’t
show uninteresting action that
can be covered by a brief subtitle. For
example, if your characters are at the seashore
for one scene, and the next important
bit of action occurs at the city home, instead
of the uninteresting scenes showing the characters
boarding a train, arriving in the city
and so on, use a brief insert, “Back in the
City,” and take up your action there. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>insert saves a lot of uninteresting action that
would only bore the audience, while on the
other hand, if you were to switch your characters
suddenly from the seashore to the
city without a word of explanation the spectator
would be mystified and in doubt as
to just what was happening.</p>

<p>Remember that the more principal characters
you introduce in your story the more
difficult you make it for the audience to follow
the thread of the plot. Of course, you
can have all the minor characters, such as
servants, that you like, but have your story
told by the actions of a few principals. This
regard for simplicity should be followed in
the manner of telling your story.</p>

<p>“What subjects are in demand?” For the
outside writer the market is always best for
the shorter pictures, comedies or dramas
running one, two, or three reels in length.
Comedies of merit are in greatest demand,
not because more comedies are produced—the
reverse is actually the case—but because less
good comedy is written. Follow the pictures
that are being shown in the theaters if you
would keep in definite touch with the studio
demands, or else read one of the trade journals
that give theater-owners advance information
of the pictures that are to be produced.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>
<p>The trade journals will also be your guide
when it comes to selling your photoplay.
By reading the manufacturers’ advertisements
there you will learn the type of picture
each company is producing, and this
is the first and most important lesson in
the marketing of photoplays. Follow the
players, and if you have a story especially
suited to a certain player send it to his
company first. The trade papers must
also supply you with your list of addresses,
for any roster printed in a book is certain to
be out of date within a few months after the
book is off the press.</p>

<p>Typewrite your manuscript. Here are
other rules of the game which the beginner
often disregards: Write on only one side
of the paper; use white paper about eight
and a half by eleven; put your name and
address on the first page of the manuscript;
and, most important of all, inclose a stamped
and addressed envelope for the return of the
story should it be unavailable. Make carbon
copies of all your stories.</p>

<p>Make certain that your story is good by all
the tests you can devise, and then pin your
faith to it and keep it in the mails until it sells.
Don’t hesitate to rewrite it, however, if after a
few months you feel that it can be improved.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>
<p>Were we asked to confine our advice to
would-be photoplaywrights to one sentence,
we could give no better hint than, “Study
the screen.” There, in three words, is contained
the one big secret of success in the
picture field. See all the pictures you can,
occasionally see them more than once, and
<i>study</i> them.</p>

<p class="ph3">TECHNIQUE OF THE PHOTOPLAY</p>


<p>For the purpose of making clear the
strictly technical aspects of photoplay-writing
it has been decided best to provide a
model “scenario,” as the manuscript form
of the photoplay is called. Explanatory notations
are made on the different points in
construction developed. From the model
given here the beginner will understand the
manner in which he must develop his story,
scene by scene, telling of each move made
by the characters.</p>

<p>“How many scenes are there in one reel?”
is a question often asked by beginners, when
a little thought should show them that the
number will vary, depending on the length
of the individual scenes. The average is
between thirty-five and forty. It will be
seen that the model runs over forty, but many
of the scenes are the briefest of flashes. Remember,
“a scene is the action that can be
photographed without stopping the camera.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>No matter how short your scene seems, if
you feel that the camera-man would have to
stop grinding, and move his camera to take
in the next action, then you know that the
next action must be numbered as another
scene. The form for photoplays of more than
one reel is similar to that given here. The
author may suit his own convenience in deciding
whether to number his scenes from
beginning to end of the story or to number
each reel separately.</p>

<p>The author is indebted to the Edison Company
for the privilege of using the scenario
of the one-reel photoplay, “Across the Great
Divide,” by Edward C. Taylor. The notes
in brackets are solely explanatory and are
not part of the scenario.</p>

<p>If you desire, an outer sheet may carry
the name of the photoplay, the number of
reels, whether it is comedy or drama, your
name and address, and a line, “Submitted at
usual rates.” The first page proper of your
scenario will read:</p>

“ACROSS THE GREAT DIVIDE”<br>
<br>
SYNOPSIS<br>
</p>

<p>Bob Carson, a young man from the country,
leaves for the city in order that he may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>earn enough money to marry Mary Carter.
After several years of plodding effort he is
shown as a telegraph operator in a Rocky
Mountain station. Black Jack and his band
plan to hold up a train carrying a large shipment
of gold, and, in order that their crime
may be covered up, decide to cause a head-on
collision. They force Carson to send the
message that will cause the accident, under
the cover of their guns, with the certainty
that if he refuses he will be killed and Black
Jack, an ex-telegrapher, will send the message
himself. Immediately afterward he
receives a message apprising him that his
sweetheart is dead. With nothing left in life to
live for he jumps to the telegraph instrument
and, before the bandit realizes what he is
doing, countermands his orders, saying as he
does so: “There will be no wreck now. We
will meet across the Great Divide.” As the
last click of the instrument ceases, the bandit,
realizing what he has done, shoots him
dead.</p>

<p>[From three hundred to five hundred words
should suffice for your synopsis. Have it tell
all the important points of your story, but
don’t go into unnecessary detail that the action
scenario can explain. The synopsis is
the most important part of your manuscript;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>it is the first thing the editor reads—and
often the last. Make it clear, convincing,

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Scene 1. <i>New England farm-yard.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Carson with old-fashioned portmanteau on
scene. Calls Mary, she appears, they embrace.
He bids her good-by, telling her he
is going West to make a home for her. She
breaks down as he exits.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Scene 2. <i>On a Chicago River wharf.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Scene 5. <i>Attic room.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Carson, twelve years old, studying telegraphy,
picking at instrument, following instructions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>in book. Mother enters and
scolds, making him study school-books.

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Scene 6. <i>Wharf; as in 2.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Carson goes off to follow up inspiration.</p>

<p>[The subtitle is here inserted before Scene
2 to prepare the audience for the break in
the action. While it says that Carson is
destitute, the action of the scene carries the
explanation still further. Don’t let your
subtitle spoil the scene by telling too much.
By dissolving the other scenes, that is, narrowing
the lens so that they “fade” in and
out, the audience knows that they represent
Carson’s thoughts. An abrupt change of
scene would mystify the audience. In practice
the director may decide to use double
exposure for these scenes, but it is best for
the author to leave these special effects to
the producer’s discretion.]</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Scene 7.</p>

<p><i>Exterior Western Union city office.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Carson comes out of office with long tickets
in hand. Pauses to register, “Thank God!”
and happiness. Exits.</p>

<p>[To “register” means to convey a certain
feeling to the audience. The long tickets let
the spectator know that Carson is going a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>great distance, without the necessity of an
abrupt subtitle stating the fact.]</p>

<p>[Note the strength gained by inserting the
subtitle in the action of the scene and having
it a speech by one of the characters. How
much weaker would it have been had the
author put his subtitle before or after the
scene, and said, “The desperados decide to

their crime by forcing the despatcher to
drive No. 2 into No. 5.”]</p>

novel. Carson orders him to put up signal
lamps—no ears. Carson tosses heavy
object on floor near him and boy nearly falls
out of chair; starts off on “hot-foot” with
lanterns.</p>

<p>[The audience must now be kept in touch
with events happening at different points.
The flashes of the desperados will show them
moving toward a definite object, and we are
satisfied. If we were shown the despatch-office,
however, with Carson seated idly at
his key, the scene would appear unnecessary,
so the author introduces such “business” as
that of the call-boy above. The author must
hold his audience’s interest while bringing his
characters together for the climax. However,
don’t let such “business” be important enough
to distract the attention from the main plot.]</p>

(Follow with description of Black

Bird as guard, and enters station.</p>

<p>[Two purposes are served by the author’s
introduction of this poster. He has let us
know that Black Jack is an unusually desperate
character from the fact that so large a
reward is offered, and, of even greater importance
to the story, he has told us that Black
Jack is a capable telegraph operator. Both are
points necessary to the plot later on and skill
is shown in introducing them indirectly now.
How unconvincing it would have been to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>Black Jack say later to Carson, “I am an old

<p class="ph3">PICTURE-PRODUCING BY AMATEURS</p>


<p>Motion pictures have become so intimate
a part of our life that it is only
natural to see amateur theatrical societies
and other organizations becoming interested
to the point of staging their own productions.</p>

<p>To the amateur the ideal manner of staging
a motion picture is, of course, to handle
every detail of the production within the organization,
merely going outside to rent a
camera, purchase film stock, and finally for
the factory work of developing and printing
the film. The pleasure of “doing everything
yourself” is almost too great to be resisted,
but if a successful production is to be assured
it is wise to call on professional help in other
branches. Unless the organization has within
its ranks a photographer of more than ordinary
ability, who is willing to spend some
time and money in preliminary study of the
motion-picture camera, and in wasting film
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>in experimentation, it is necessary that a
professional camera-man be engaged. Again,
were the organization to decide to dispense
with the services of a professional photographer
it might be necessary to purchase a
camera—at prices ranging from two hundred
and fifty dollars upward—since it would
probably be difficult to find a company willing
to intrust one of its cameras on rental to
an amateur.</p>

<p>Should the organization be willing to go
a step further in seeking the aid of professionals,
the services of a capable motion-picture
director would go a long way toward
the betterment of the final production. We
believe it possible for an amateur with the
dramatic sense, following the director’s method
of work as outlined in this book, to stage
a satisfactory picture without the services of
a professional director. But this would depend
largely on the quality of the co-operation
extended by the camera-man.</p>

<p>Let us proceed in this chapter on the
assumption that you have decided to engage
a professional camera-man, but you are going
to place your trust for all other details
on your own members.</p>

<p>The cost—that is the first question the
amateur asks, and, naturally, the one that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>must be settled before any organization will
embark on such a venture as the staging of
a motion picture. We have told you in a
preceding chapter that the film-producing
companies calculate the cost of the average
picture at one dollar per foot. With the
amateur organization conditions are of course
different, and this estimate furnishes no basis
of comparison. In enumerating the items
of expense to the amateur we must first consider
the cost of film stock. This is about
three and three-quarters cents per foot;
positive film is a trifle higher than negative,
but this figure may be taken as an average.
It must be understood that there is always
more film stock used than the length of the
finished production would indicate. We will
say that you intend to produce a three-reel
picture, running approximately three thousand
feet and providing three-quarters of an
hour of entertainment. About four thousand
feet of film would be used—a moderate estimate—allowing
one thousand feet for film
spoiled or omitted from the picture in the
final assembling to improve the continuity
and clarity of the story. The raw stock for
the negative and positive prints would therefore
cost three hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Then there would be the expense of developing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>the negative and printing the positive,
which, including the printed inserts,
would be about six cents per foot. The cost
of our three-reel film, with one thousand feet
allowed for waste, would now be two hundred
and forty dollars, plus the cost of the raw
stock, or five hundred and forty dollars.
These calculations are based on the average
market prices, though slight variations must
of course be expected.</p>

<p>With the matter of film and printing
settled, we take up expenses that cannot be
so definitely decided. Under ordinary conditions
the staging of a three-reel picture by
amateurs should require about four weeks,
somewhat longer than the professional would
take, but not as long as the amateurs will
require, unless the members are determined to
work hard and use every available moment
of sunshine until the picture is completed.
Our estimate of four weeks is based on the
understanding that the amateurs will be
ready to start work at nine o’clock in the
morning and, with the exception of a little
over an hour for lunch, work until five
o’clock. The salary of a photographer, supplying
his own camera, would be between
one hundred and one hundred and fifty
dollars per week. The cost of our production
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>now jumps from five hundred and
forty dollars to ten hundred and forty dollars,
figuring the camera-man’s salary at one
hundred and twenty-five dollars per week.
If it should be decided to engage a director
the organization will be able to find capable
men at salaries starting at the two-hundred-dollar
level.</p>

<p>The salaries of players and the expense
of purchasing a story do not enter into our
calculations here. The matter of costuming
is one that should not trouble the amateur
either, for his story should be written so as
to make the lightest of demands in this regard.
The members of the organization
should also be able to secure the necessary
permission for the use of all exterior settings
without paying for the privilege, as the film-manufacturing
concerns must often do. It is
also possible for the author of the story to so
construct it that no interior settings are
necessary, thus obviating the expense of engaging
a studio or else of paying for portable
lights to be used in the actual interiors
mentioned in the story. The advantages
offered by the locality in which the story is
to be pictured will determine the decision to
be made on these points. There is another
point to consider; only organizations located
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>near film-producing centers will be
able to rent studios without the expense of
transportation for the company.</p>

<p>On the story depends in great measure the
success or failure of an amateur effort at
screen production. While the principal idea,
the plot, may be the work of one man, the
work of production should not begin until
every point in it has been threshed out by
the combined wisdom of all the members of
the committee in charge of the production.
Test each bit of the action to see that it can
be done with your facilities; don’t attempt
an elaborate story and then be forced to rewrite
it after the work of production has
started. That means time lost—for which
you are paying salaries—and a weakened
production. Construct a story, as has been
said above, that uses exterior scenes almost
entirely. See that the locations are convenient;
it does not require many journeys
from one end of the town to the other to eat
up valuable time. Don’t hesitate to use the
same setting more than once. The points
enumerated here would appear to be only
“common sense,” yet it is our experience
with the efforts of amateur photoplaywrights
that they invariably lift the check-reins from
their imaginations, allow the story to wander
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>up hill and down dale, and seem to make a
special effort to have each bit of action take
place in an entirely new location.</p>

<p>If the organization holds within its membership-lists
some players of more than ordinary
ability it might be possible to successfully
stage an ambitious drama. For
productions of this type the light comedy
form is, however, best suited. The rôles, being
more natural, are better handled by the players,
while at the showing of the picture the
audience, instead of being in the seriously
critical frame of mind induced by a drama,
is receptive and ready to overlook minor
faults. The exaggerated melodrama is probably
the greatest favorite with amateurs.</p>

<p>Remember the words of advice in a preceding
chapter about limiting the number of
principal characters, and avoid the danger of
confusing the audience by having too many
important rôles. This is a matter for delicate
handling in amateur productions where
many members will be found to feel that they
should not be slighted. It is of value in increasing
the interest to include in the picture
at least one or two scenes in which all
the members of the organization have an
opportunity to be photographed. A lawn
fête, political meeting, or any such affair
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>may be the justification for their appearing
in the picture. But see that some action of
value in the unfolding of your story happens
in this scene, for it must appear natural, and
not as if it were dragged in by the collar.</p>

<p>Give to the man you name “director”
supreme charge after the story has been approved
by the committee and the work of
production is about to start. Except perhaps
for evening conferences to decide on the
next day’s plan of work the time has now arrived
to place entire command in the hands
of one man. Let him decide the order in
which the scenes are to be taken, issue the
“calls” for the players needed each day,
rehearse the scenes, and give the final word
when he deems it time to photograph the
scene. The director should not be a person
who is to play a part in the picture, unless
it is to appear in one of the scenes we have
mentioned which will allow the entire membership
to be seen.</p>

<p>The director should have two assistants,
a “location” man and a “property” man.
The “location-man’s” task is to seek the
various spots that will be used as settings
and to make the necessary arrangements
with the owners for their use on the date set.
The “property-man” must see that all the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>necessary paraphernalia, such as carriages,
swords, letters, or any article needed in the
different scenes, is on hand and ready for
use when the director calls. Both these
aides must work from two to three days in
advance of the director, so that there will be
no annoying delays because a certain spot
cannot be used on the day desired, or because
a table and chair needed in one of the
scenes is not at hand. These assistants, or
others appointed, should also watch the staging
of the scenes, with especial care for the
minor details that might escape the eye of
the director who is sufficiently burdened in
seeking to interpret the story. The assistants,
for example, will make notes of the
clothes worn by the players in the different
scenes, so that, a week later, when scenes
are being taken that in the story are supposed
to happen on the same day, there will
be no absurd mistakes. Unless careful notes
are made of these matters it is easy to slip
and show us, when the picture is exhibited,
a character starting out on an auto
ride with a soft hat, Norfolk coat, and soft-collared
shirt, only to arrive at his destination
wearing a golfing-cap, severely cut business
jacket, and immaculate in a stiff linen
collar. In the case of female characters, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>their more extensive wardrobes and innate
desire for change, this danger of ridiculous
errors is magnified. The lot of the director’s
assistants will not be an easy one.</p>

<p>For the director himself the methods of
work have been outlined in a preceding
chapter. First, in collaboration with his assistants,
a “scene plot” is laid out; that is,
a list of the locations needed, and the number
of the scenes in which they will be used.
Similarly a “property” list is made out.
Let him also determine, as we have shown
the professional director doing, the order in
which he will stage his scenes. A convenient
plan now is to have the complete scenario
typewritten, each scene on a separate sheet
of paper, and placed in a loose-leaf binding
in the order decided upon for production.
The director will find that this makes it
much easier to study the individual scenes
thoroughly, to so “visualize” them as to
secure their full possibilities.</p>

<p>In taking the scenes, let the director remember
one particular point: Rehearse,
rehearse, rehearse, before the camera is
turned an inch. Once the camera starts to
“grind” you are using film, and if everything
is not perfect you are either wasting money
on scenes that will have to be retaken, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>else you are weakening the picture should
the faults be overlooked. In rehearsing, the
director must not only assure himself that
the players are capably interpreting the emotions
called for by the story, but he must
also see that there is no danger of their
stepping outside the lines of the camera’s
vision in the excitement of the action after
photography has started. Experience with
two or three scenes will show the director
that this happens more often than would
seem possible. Before the final word of approval
is given the players must go through
their parts as though they were “second
nature,” for the camera registers everything,
and the look to the side-lines, the glance at
the director for instructions that would go
by unnoticed on the stage, will be caught by
the camera and cannot be erased except by
taking the scene over again.</p>

<p>After a rehearsal or two the camera-man
will time the scene for the director so that
he can tell how much film it will use, and if
it is not in agreement with the estimate allowed
in the scenario, make the necessary
changes. The camera-man will lay out the
boundary-lines of the stage for you and advise
you on the distance from the camera to
station the players. This will vary according
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>to the number of characters in the scene and
size of the stage required for the particular
bit of action. For ordinary scenes it is wise
not to allow the players to be farther than
fifteen feet from the camera, and frequently
for a tense bit of action in which a few players
are seen they should be brought up to the
ten-foot line. In acting the players should
move a trifle slower, more deliberately, than
they ordinarily would.</p>

<p>The length of your scenes is limited by
the film capacity of the camera, usually two
hundred feet. This would mean a scene of
about three minutes’ duration, but you should
be sparing in your use of scenes even approaching
this length, as it does not require
many of them to eat up an entire picture.
If it should be necessary in developing the
story to use a very long scene, see if some
means of variation cannot be introduced by
showing some bit of action in the story transpiring
at some other point. Three minutes
seem very short to the layman, but if you
will time some of the scenes in the next picture
you see you will find that very few run
even a fourth that length.</p>

<p>If you do not happen to be near one of the
large film-producing centers where there are
plenty of laboratories, your camera-man may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>be relied on for advice in locating a plant to
develop and print the film. It will be wise
for the director to make the journey to the
film plant and view the picture and assemble
it there.</p>

<p>For showing to the organization’s members
and friends a local theater may be secured;
or else, should it be decided to use the clubhouse,
a projection-machine can be rented
and an operator engaged. Reference to the
telephone-book of the nearest large city will
give you the names of many accessory companies
providing machines and operators for
such engagements. It will probably be necessary,
to comply with the local fire-department
rules, to rent a portable asbestos booth.
Rules vary, but you are apt to save considerable
eleventh-hour trouble if you get in
touch with the local fire and building departments
before attempting to show the
picture.</p>

<p>A parting word as to the time of the year
to stage your picture. This will vary in
some parts of the country of course, but in
general it may be said that the spring and
summer are the ideal times. Not only are
conditions for exterior work not pleasant
in the fall and winter, but a light snow-fall
which you would imagine would only delay
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>the picture a day may easily hold it up for
many more until all the snow is off the ground,
for otherwise you face the danger of showing
scenes supposed to happen on the same day
with snow on the ground in one view and none
in sight in another.</p>
